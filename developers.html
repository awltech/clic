		<p>CLiC being an open-source application, we need to add a header refering to the license on top of each source file. To do so, we're using a Maven plugin, and here's how to update the header on top of each file of CLiC project: from the root project of CLiC, simply execute this Maven command: <code>mvn clean license:format</code>.</p>
		<p>Yep, that's all!</p>

		<p>Here are a few basic rules that should be followed while committing some source code in CLiC:
			<ul>
				<li>Any commited source code should compile,</li>
				<li>Any commited source code should be tested and work efficiently,</li>
				<li>Any commited source code should be documented using javadoc,</li>
				<li>Any commit should have a clear message commit explaining the aim of the contribution,</li>
				<li>Only one issue should be resolved per commit,</li>
				<li>All the source code should be formatted using Eclipse's default formatter,</li>
				<li>No Eclipse warnings should be found in the source code,</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>While CLiC allows to define tasks which are based on Maven, thanks to its generic Maven plugin, we thought that it might be useful to ease a little bit Maven interactions for people aiming at developing new tasks or plugins relying on Maven. That's why we just developed a small Java library: <a href="https://github.com/awltech/clic-utils" target="_blank">clic-utils</a> which contains some APIs easing Maven interactions.</p>
			<p>The aim of this library is to help you:
				<ul>
					<li>Generating pom.xml files using some templates,</li>
					<li>Generating Maven queries to be invoked,</li>
					<li>Dealing with CLiC-compliant command lines using the same parser,</li>
					<li>Executing Maven commands in various modes (using a pom.xml file, or invoking plugins),</li>
					<li>Filtering the outputs in order to retrieve some results of the execution</li>
				</ul>
				And many other small features that could help you while developing things relying on Maven.
			</p>
			<p>We don't provide any detailed documentation on that API right now, as everything contains javadoc and is quite easy to use. We'll write down some documentation if needed.</p>
