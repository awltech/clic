		<p>CLiC being an open-source application, we need to add a header refering to the license on top of each source file. To do so, we're using a Maven plugin, and here's how to update the header on top of each file of CLiC project: from the root project of CLiC, simply execute this Maven command: <code>mvn clean license:format</code>.</p>
		<p>Yep, that's all!</p>
