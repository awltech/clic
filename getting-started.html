		<p>CLiC is a complete tooling relying on Eclipse, so first of all, if Eclipse isn't installed on your workstation, you'll need to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">install it</a>.</p>
		<p>CLiC consists in a set of Eclipse plugins, so you'll need to use Eclipse's way to install plugins: simply go to <strong>Help &gt; Install New Software...</strong>, and then specify CLiC's update site URL, which you can find in the detailed list below:
		</p>
		<h4>Update sites</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/kepler/" target="_blank">Eclipse Kepler</a>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>0.1.0</strong>: <a href="http://eclipse.worldline.com/releases/kepler/clic/">http://eclipse.worldline.com/releases/kepler/clic/</a></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Here's the result you should see on Eclipse while using the update site:</p>

		<h3 class="panel-title">Using the Console view</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>There are various ways of interacting with CLiC. The first available one is to use an Eclipse console. In order to do this, simply open the Console view from Eclipse: <strong>Window > Show View > Console</strong>. This Eclipse console mechanism allows to deal with various consoles at the same time, so you'll need to open CLiC's one: </p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/console.png" alt="CLiC Console"/></center></p>
		<p>Then, you can simply type your commands in this console, and get the results in the exact same location. For example, you can type <code>list</code> or <code>help -c list</code> to get information about the available commands, or to get some help about a specific command:</p>

		<p>Rather than using the Eclipse console which has been presented previously, it's also possible to use CLiC from a dedicated Eclipse view. In order to do so, you'll just have to open this specific view from Eclipse: <strong>Window > Show View > Other... > CLiC</strong>. Don't hesitate to use the search box if you can't find CLiC in the categories:</p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/view.png" alt="CLiC View"/></center></p>
		<p>From this view, you'll be able to type your commands and see the execution's results:</p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/view2.png" alt="CLiC View"/></center></p>
		<p>From this view, you'll also be able to clear the console's history if too much information are present:</p>
