		<p>CLiC is a complete tooling relying on Eclipse, so first of all, if Eclipse isn't installed on your workstation, you'll need to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">install it</a>.</p>
		<p>CLiC consists in a set of Eclipse plugins, so you'll need to use Eclipse's way to install plugins: simply go to <strong>Help &gt; Install New Software...</strong>, and then specify CLiC's update site URL, which you can find in the detailed list below:
		</p>
		<h4>Update sites</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/kepler/" target="_blank">Eclipse Kepler</a>:</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>0.1.0</strong>: <a href="http://eclipse.worldline.com/releases/kepler/clic/">http://eclipse.worldline.com/releases/kepler/clic/</a></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Here's the result you should see on Eclipse while using the update site:</p>

		<h3 class="panel-title">Using the Console view</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>There are various ways of interacting with CLiC. The first available one is to use an Eclipse console. In order to do this, simply open the Console view from Eclipse: <strong>Window > Show View > Console</strong>. This Eclipse console mechanism allows to deal with various consoles at the same time, so you'll need to open CLiC's one: </p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/console.png" alt="CLiC Console"/></center></p>
		<p>Then, you can simply type your commands in this console, and get the results in the exact same location. For example, you can type <code>list</code> or <code>help -c list</code> to get information about the available commands, or to get some help about a specific command:</p>

		<div class="alert alert-warning"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span> <strong>Warning:</strong> Even if using the Console view will provide the same features, we recommend to use the dedicated Eclipse view for a better user experience.</div>

	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>Rather than using the Eclipse console which has been presented previously, it's also possible to use CLiC from a dedicated Eclipse view. In order to do so, you'll just have to open this specific view from Eclipse: <strong>Window > Show View > Other... > CLiC</strong>. Don't hesitate to use the search box if you can't find CLiC in the categories:</p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/view.png" alt="CLiC View"/></center></p>
		<p>From this view, you'll be able to type your commands and see the execution's results:</p>
		<p><center><img src="resources/view2.png" alt="CLiC View"/></center></p>
		<p>From this view, you'll also be able to clear the console's history if too much information are present:</p>

<span id="history-autocomplete"></span>

		<h3 class="panel-title">Using the command history and content assist</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<h4>0. History</h4>
		<p>Just like in lots of existing command line tools, CLiC allows you to retrieve easily your commands execution history. It uses the standard behavior of most clients: just hit the <strong>up arrow</strong> key in order to go to the previously executed command, which you can repeat in order to navigate in the past... And on the other side, you can simply use <strong>down arrow</strong> as well in order to come back to the earlier executed commands. Simply hit <strong>enter</strong> while navigating in the commands allows you to execute the one which is displayed!</p>
		<h4>1. Content assist</h4>
		<p>In the same spirit, CLiC allows you to use some autocompletion while writing your commands (just like lots of clients do). One interesting thing is that this content assist feature works both on commands and their parameters. In order to use this feature, simply hit <strong>tab</strong> key while typing your command, or the classical <strong>ctrl + space</strong> shortcut from Eclipse, and if there's an unique possibility matching what you typed, it'll be autocompleted.</p>
